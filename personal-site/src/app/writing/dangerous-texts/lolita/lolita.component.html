    <h2>Lawless Lolita – The Power of Rhetoric and Personal Cross-Examination</h2>


    <p>In the court of law in the United States of America, there are several components to a legal trial. These components include a jury selection, opening statements, presentation of cases (including witness examination and objections), closing arguments, jury instructions, jury deliberations, and the announcement of the verdict. Set in 1950s America, author Vladimir Nabokov selects the readers of Lolita as the jury for the “trial” of protagonist Humbert Humbert. Though opening statements are instructed to be from both the defense and the prosecutor, Nabokov makes it evident in the first chapter of Lolita with exclusively Humbert’s opening statement that the only side the jury will hear from during this “trial” is Humbert’s defense presented by none other than himself. From chapter two through to chapter thirty-six of the novel, Lolita, the ambiguous presentment of cases and witness examination is left for the reader to sift through on their own accord. In chapter thirty-six of Lolita, Nabokov allows Humbert Humbert to provide his closing arguments, pleading to the audience “Had I come before myself, I would have given Humbert at least thirty-five years for rape, and dismissed the rest of the charges (Lolita, 308).” It is only here that the audience learns he is standing trial for, presumably (never to be explicitly stated), the murder of Clare Quilty. Upon conclusion of Lolita, Nabokov leaves the jury instructions, deliberations, and verdict to be interpreted by the reader as they reflect on the story they’ve just finished. It is through his rhetorical techniques during the “presentment of cases” that Nabokov leaves the audience with the job of determining the nature of the crime and the exact degree of forgiveness or condemnation of Humbert Humbert.</p>

    <br/>

    <p>Being objective of oneself and one’s own actions is an extremely difficult task. It is no surprise, then, that in the court of law one of the most important aspects of defense is a good lawyer. In the novel Lolita, Nabokov makes the decision to have Humbert Humbert provide his own defense to the audience for his crimes. This choice of point of view is one of the most powerful rhetorical techniques in the story of Lolita. By putting the novel into the perspective of Humbert Humbert himself, Nabokov leaves the audience to condemn Humbert Humbert on their own terms. In articulating the story through H.H.’s point of view, the audience is challenged for themselves to question H.H.’s testimony and determine the nature of the crime and the exact degree of forgiveness or condemnation. By forcing the audience to spend the duration of their reading directly confronting H.H.’s point of view the audience is forced to work through separating his actions from his own interpretation and see the story objectively. Directly at the beginning of the novel, the way in which Nabokov sets up H.H. to paint the picture of his defense is one riddled with rhetoric. The last line of chapter 1 reads “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number 1 is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns.” (Lolita, 9) Though it is common for attorneys to persuasively play, pushing people to come to certain conclusions about crimes committed, having this rhetoric come directly from Humbert removes an important layer of accountability required among lawyers to uphold the law. By choosing to articulate Dolores Haze’s story directly through the perpetrator, Nabokov is directly delivering the duty of determining the nature of the crime and the exact degree of forgiveness or condemnation of Humbert Humbert to the audience. </p>

    <br/>

    <p>Once the audience comes to an understanding of the point of view of the story before them, the audience is forced to then lay witness to the way in which Humbert Humbert narrates his own story. In a standard trial, the only time a defendant speaks not through their attorney is upon cross-examination of their testimony in which both the prosecution and the defense have the opportunity to question them. However, due to the point of view of Lolita, Humbert is the only voice the “jury” hears from. Given this unique approach to a trial, Humbert is never subject to true cross-examination. This is something the audience must do for themselves as they find points of inquiry within H.H.’s narration. Nabokov diligently depicts Humbert Humbert to highlight himself as the honest, honorable, and humble narrator of the story of Lolita. Though as the audience works through Humbert’s testimony, finding flaws or points of confusion, his carefully crafted character comes into question. Using seductive language, the audience is subject to H.H.’s tactics of emotional manipulation in justification of his crimes (though, notably, only briefly the crimes he’s actually on trial for (Lolita, 308)). From his early life story (Lolita, 9-34) to the “enchanting” travels across the country with Dolores Haze (Lolita, 109-176) and ending with his alleged vengeance “on behalf of” Dolores (Lolita, 281-309), Humbert Humbert provides a challenging voice for his audience to work through. By forcing the audience to see the story through solely H.H.’s own personal testimony, Nabokov drives the audience to understand Humbert on their own terms. Using this rhetorical technique, Nabokov shows it’s imperative the reader is able to step outside of the whimsical wording to determine the nature of the crime and the exact degree of forgiveness or condemnation of Humbert Humbert for themselves. Upon setting the scene in chapter 13, Humbert Humbert’s voice shines through as he makes a direct call to his audience: </p>

    <br/>

    <p>“I want my learned readers to participate in the scene I am about to replay; I want them to examine every detail and see for themselves how careful, how chaste, the whole wine-sweet event is if viewed with what my lawyer has called, ‘impartial sympathy.’ So let us get started. I have a difficult job before me (Lolita, 57).”</p>

    <br/>
    
    <p>Nabokov begins by having Humbert attempt to appeal to his audience by referring to them as “learned” as a way of playing to the juror’s ego as an astute observer of the law at work. Humbert is working to establish his character as thorough and reliable as he himself provides “every detail’ for the audience to examine. Nabokov even writes Humbert to go so far as to make a call to H.H.’s lawyer, who has allegedly vouched for his character though the lawyer's voice is only ever heard through Humbert. It is in this particularly powerful passage the audience is witness to how Nabokov uses H.H.’s voice as a tool of rhetoric to challenge the reader to see through the performance Humbert is putting on. Here the readers are made to decide for themselves where the carefully created character of their narrator ends and where the real Humbert begins as they determine the nature of the crime and the exact degree of forgiveness or condemnation of Humbert Humbert.</p>

    <br/>

    <p>Upon working through Humbert Humbert’s point of view and voice, separating his interpretation and articulation of events from the actual events themselves, the audience is then challenged with working through the character that has been created before them. Often in criminal trials in addition to cross-examination of the defendant, often character witnesses are brought in and subject to cross-examination in an attempt to dissect the character of the defendant. Often these character witnesses would be people who have spent time around the defendant and can testify to the true nature of the defendant with questions from both the prosecution and the defense. However, because Nabokov elects to keep the novel outside of the courtroom, the only testimony of Humbert’s character provided to the audience is Humbert’s own interpretation of himself. Humbert describes himself to be an intelligent, well-educated middle-class man with good manners and a sharp tongue. His attractive appearance and charismatic nature make him a challenging character to cut through. In chapter 7 of the novel, Humbert says </p>

    <br/>

    <p>“I was, and still am, despite mes malheurs, an exceptionally handsome male; slow-moving, tall, with soft dark hair and a gloomy but all the more seductive cast of demeanor (…) I could obtain at the snap of my fingers any adult female I chose; in fact, it had become quite a habit with me of not being too attentive to women lest they come toppling, bloodripe, into my cold lap (Lolita, 25).”</p>

    <br/>

    <p>Here the audience can see how Nabokov gives leeway to Humbert to stroke his own ego and play to the trope of the infinitely desirable, tall, dark, and handsome character that occurs in many a romance novel. H.H.’s cleverly placed French and history of womanizing charm creates a Playboy-like picture of a man who would have no real reason to have committed the heinous crimes he will come to admit to if not for the passion with which he presents them. But when the audience sorts the true nature of the character he’s created, they come to realize that, regardless of these traits, he is first and foremost completely manipulative as women fall into his admittedly “cold lap”. The duality of being a clever and handsome lover but one simultaneously incapable of attending to these women’s desires provides the foundation of his unreliable character who will do anything to achieve his goals. By having Humbert sit in such a duality, Nabokov sets up yet another opportunity for the audience to determine the nature of the crime and the exact degree of forgiveness or condemnation of Humbert Humbert.</p>

    <br/>

    <p>Working through the skewed point of view, the manipulative voice, and the capricious character of Humbert Humbert can come to leave the audience untrusting of anything Humbert has to offer. It is here the audience questions what exactly they’re reading. Though the audience still stands as somewhat “jurors” on a “trial” they’re fully aware that what they’re reading is not a stenographer's statement of stories said under oath. What they’re reading, of course, is Humbert’s very own diary, not bound to the same rules and regulations of testimony under oath in a courtroom. A diary is supposed to be one’s most intimate thoughts on paper. By using diary-style narration within Lolita the audience is subject to H.H.’s most vulnerable confessions through the process of his testimony. Throughout the duration of the novel, the audience is witness to the way H.H. is able to use his intelligence and charisma to navigate the world around him and escape accusations of his sex crimes against Dolores Haze. Humbert directly addresses his “jury” in regard to such crimes as he says, upon drugging Dolores at The Enchanted Hunters, “Gentlewomen of the jury! Bear with me! Allow me to take just a tiny bit of your precious time (Lolita, 123)!” Here Humbert is directly calling upon the women, whom he has previously recognised he has power over, to plead to their emotions prior to continuing in divulging the disgusting acts he does to Dolores. Despite being a diary, he spends a significant amount of time pleading with his audience and building a case that has yet to be necessary. When reflecting on the other forms of rhetoric used thus far, and allowing them to establish a base for the unreliable narrator, it becomes clear this diary is not a raw reflection of his emotions nor a reliable account of events as they occurred. Here Nabokov makes it clear that the diary-style narration is merely another rhetorical device meant to challenge the audience to sift through what should be raw and vulnerable thoughts to determine the nature of the crime and the exact degree of forgiveness or condemnation of Humbert Humbert.</p>

    <br/>

    <p>Though the audience never witnesses the events of the trial, and even if they were it’s clear the words of Humbert Humbert are not to be trusted, Nabokov still leaves the reader with the infinitely challenging job of searching for the truth. This search is a nearly impossible task as the reader has no basis for cross-examination other than personally interrogating the story that Humbert provides to them due to the absence of the prosecution. In presenting crime after crime, manipulation after manipulation, Humbert Humbert quickly becomes one of the most challenging characters Nabokov has ever written to work through objectively. With a keen eye and careful consideration, the reader will inevitably catch themselves confronting the ways in which Humbert leaves holes in his narration and proves himself to be an unreliable narrator. Nabokov’s carefully selected point of view, voice, character, and diary-style narration are all powerful tools of rhetoric that leave the audience with the job of determining the nature of the crime and the exact degree of forgiveness or condemnation of Humbert Humbert upon the conclusion of the novel Lolita.</p>
